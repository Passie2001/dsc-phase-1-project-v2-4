

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, I overwhelmingly support the assertion that drama is indeed the most dominated genre in world. As per the bar graph, Genre vs popularity drama came first with 179 points. The success of classic theatrical works and also the widespread consumption of dramatic films has greatly contributed to popularity of drama. Despite the rise of other genres such as comedy and several emerging forms of entertainment, the enduring appeal of drama remains undeniable.

The evidence presented regarding the relationship between the high ratings and the revenue collected clearly illustrates that there is little to no correlation between the ratings and revenue. In the coming days, it will be of importance to continue researching the complexities of movie success and audience preferences. Through that, the filmmakers can be better supported in creating meaningful, impactful works of art that resonate with audiences on a deeper level. The true success of cinema lies in the ability to captivate, inspire, and provoke thought, regardless of commercial metrics.
